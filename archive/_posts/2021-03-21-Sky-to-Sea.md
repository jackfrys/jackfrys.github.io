Not in a day, but in a weekend. Yesterday was skiing, and today we went to Malibu. The air was warm and the sun was out, but the wind made Zuma beach less than pleasant to sit on. We lasted about twenty minutes - enough time to eat sandwiches and have a drink, but that was too long to get so pelted by sand. Fortunately we found a short hike at Point Dume to keep us busy.

Driving the Pacific Coast Highway was a thrill, if not for the heavy traffic. It took forty minutes to get to Santa Monica - not including a Supercharger stop that took longer than expected - and we continued further south to LAX. In all my recent visits to Los Angeles, I haven't made it much south of the airport.
