Monday afternoon marked my departure from Pasadena. It was time for a change in scenery, albeit a bit ahead of being due in San Diego. I picked up Sunday's drive south of LAX on Sepulveda, again part of the Pacific Coast Highway. The route covers several coastal towns including Long Beach, but traveling that way in the early evening became painfully slow. My favorite part came later, just north of Huntington Beach, which brought uninterrupted lengths beside the water.

California Highway 1 terminates just before San Clemente, a bit to my surprise - I always assumed it would span as far south as the 5. My destination was in La Jolla, a low-stress village for a midweek stopover, and completing the PCH's southern section probably added two hours to the trip.

Pasadena is an exceptionally pleasant town - it reminds me a lot of Berkeley. Morning coffee walks are an essential part of my routine, and I never realized how much so until losing them back in January. Lake Avenue however forces me to *choose* between Dunkin' and Philz, and it's pretty darn walkable for southern California. Surely I'll be back when there's more to do.
