Earlier in March I was fortunate enough to go participate in the first-ever hackathon held at the Vatican! Yes, *the* Vatican. I came to know about the event, affectionately known as VHacks, because my roommate at Apple last year was part of the organizing team, and I applied back in December. By January I was notified of my acceptance and the fun of planning my first trip to Italy began!

I am currently working on my third co-op with HubSpot in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I didn't want to miss too much work due to the hackathon, so I booked my travel plans tightly around the four-day event. My plan was to leave from Boston Logan on Wednesday night, get there just in time for the hacking portion from Tuesday to Saturday, and depart again from Fiumicino on Monday following the Sunday activities. I found a neat itinerary on Air France featuring a transfer through Paris on the way out and an Alitalia-operated nonstop on the way back. The BOS-CDG leg was even on a Dreamliner - nice! I booked through Expedia to save $100 and submitted my travel confirmation to the VHacks team by the deadline in mid-January.

Weeks went by and little by little I found out more about the event itself. Via the social-network group set up for the participants, I found out that while many of the students attending were also from the US, many came from Europe and other places around the world as well. Aside from some partner-university groups, teams would be selected by the event staff and announced just prior to March 7.

Apparently the Holy See is interested in using technology to solve global issues, with the themes of this hackathon broadly fitting into those of social inclusion, refugee and migrant crises, and interfaith communication. On my application I had indicated my preference towards the first of which, and thus I was placed on one of the teams set to tackle human conditions that divide us.

# Beating the Storm

On Sunday night, three days before my scheduled departure, I started getting increasingly concerned about the weather forecasts for the week. The Boston area was slated to deal with a Nor'easter on Wednesday, making flight cancellations pretty likely.
