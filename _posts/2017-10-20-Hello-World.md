Mont Saint Michel

Mont Saint Michel was pretty much my favorite thing I experienced in France during my week-long trip this past summer, but boy was that a hard trip to pull off. I sensed most visitors had rental cars to get around, but not me.

My friend and I stayed over the previous night in Bayeux during a little weekend expedition to Normandy, but on Sunday morning he had to catch a train back to Paris. I considered going too, but I had vaguely heard of this place Mont Saint Michel and wanted to go check it out for myself. An array of Disney movies in which it made a cameo may have made the difference.

The night before I did some light research, and I found some tenuously-documented shuttle busses and train schedules that would probably get me where I was going. And so, I purchased a train ticket from Bayeux to Pontorson and the journey started in the morning.
