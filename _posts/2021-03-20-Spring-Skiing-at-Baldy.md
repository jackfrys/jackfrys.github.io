title: Spring Skiing at Baldy
---

I found out about Mt. Baldy during my last trip to Los Angeles two weeks ago. The goal was just to take a drive up the San Gabriel mountains, but we happened upon the small ski area. The weather was warm and no snow was in sight, but the chair from the base was spinning, offering scenic rides.

We ascended 2000 feet over a fifteen minute ride up Chair #1, and saw several skiers returning down along the way. During early and late season conditions, when snow does not cover the base, skiers must ride back to the base at the end of the day. The Notch at the top had a nice cafeteria to get lunch with a view, and across the way we could see the set of lifts leading further up to ski trails.

Today I returned, with skis, to check out the trails. It took over an hour to get there from Pasadena due to heavy traffic on the 210. Adding in a late start to the morning, I didn't get back on that same lift until noon.

No snow at the base means you can't wear your skis during the ride. Instead the lift attendant balanced mine precariously on the chair behind. From the lodge at top, a little hill down and around the right-hand corner lead me to the rest of the skiable area. Chair #2 is short and slow - it just gets you back up to the lodge. #3 is the one I lapped all day. #4 is all the way on the other side of the lodge, and it seems to be perpetually closed due to low snow totals.

There were only a few open trails to get down from the top of Chair #3, and I tried each several times. That section of the resort is 1000 feet tall, with the ride up taking eight minutes. The snow conditions were very spring-like, with soft, slushy snow throughout, with patches of frozen ice pack in the shade. The trails were surprisingly steep, and with turning being so difficult, I decided to stay out of the bowls after the first couple runs.

The large trail map posted by the lodge door was old enough to show a planned expansion for 1991. The goal was to add two new lifts on the Chair #4 side. Looks like that never happened.

My gray ski jacket complements my bright orange ski pants. But due to the warm weather, I swapped out the jacket for a lighter one - also orange. The lift attendant at the top claimed I looked like a pumpkin.

The price of the lift ticket was a little steep for what was essentially one lift and a few trails to choose from. But it was a nifty little mountain with a classic feel and interesting terrain. I'm all in for the novel experience of extending a ski season while traveling in southern California.
