Mont Saint Michel was pretty much my favorite thing I experienced in France during my week-long trip this past summer, but boy was that a hard trip to pull off. I sensed most visitors had rental cars to get around, but not me.

My friend and I stayed over the previous night in Bayeux during a little weekend expedition to Normandy, but on Sunday morning he had to catch a train back to Paris. I considered going too, but I had vaguely heard of this place Mont Saint Michel and wanted to go check it out for myself. An array of Disney movies in which it made a cameo may have made the difference.

The night before I did some light research, and I found some tenuously-documented shuttle busses and train schedules that would probably get me where I was going. And so, I purchased a train ticket from Bayeux to Pontorson and the journey was set to begin in the morning.

On the train ride to Pontorson was the one and only time in France that I needed to show my train ticket to anyone, and the conductor asked to see my ID too. That was alarming until I could decipher her French and realize there was no issue and that was all she needed, but that's when I started to feel pretty vulnerable all alone far away from the Parisians who only pretend they can't speak English.

I also bought my return train ticket and it took a few tries and some time for the credit card transaction to process. Good thing it finally did.

I took French for a few years back in high school, largely unsuccessfully, but this trip showed me that maybe there's still a little memory hanging around.

Two others and I got off the train in Pontorson, which is located about five miles south of Mont Saint Michel. Fortunately the bus I read about actually existed, and it was waiting at the rural train station when I arrived. I boarded, paid a few Euros fare, and took a seat. Only one other person and the driver were on board, much to my surprise considering how popular I thought this place was.

For years, it has always cracked me up how many people randomly appear at ski resorts. You drive for miles and miles through weaving backroads with barely any other cars in sight, and suddenly you arrive and are greeted by thousands of other visitors. Where did you all come from?

The ride from the train station took lasted about fifteen minutes before the medevial abbey came into view. When I visited, the tides were low and we drove right across the causeway and I got dropped off right near the town. I meekly asked the driver in French how to catch the bus back, and she pointed to a spot on the other side of the road.

Having already selected my train back, I had about four hours.
