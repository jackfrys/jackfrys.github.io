title: Logan Airport Shuttle
---

This weekend I'm going to Nashville and decided to fly nonstop from Boston. I drove to Framingham, Massachusetts to catch the Logan Express. The drive took a bit over two hours thanks to some traffic, and I barely caught the 3 pm shuttle after being diverted to overflow parking around the corner. There was also some traffic on the final stretch of the Mass Pike, but all we got to Terminal A at 3:45 sharp.
