I graduated in 2018 from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, where I studied computer science and minored in both mathematics and communication studies. I grew up in New England as well, about two hours outside the city. Shortly after graduation, I joined the Siri team at Apple and have been enjoying life out west.

In my free time I enjoy battling crossword puzzles, listening to music and podcasts, drinking Dunkinâ€™ Donuts, traveling, skiing, and cheering on the Red Sox and Patriots. I'm hoping to take up scuba diving again and eventually learn to fly airplanes.
