I am a fifth-year computer science student at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. I grew up in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, about two hours outside Boston. I completed my first and second co-ops at Apple working on the Siri team in Cupertino, California. Earlier this year, I split my third co-op term between a period on HubSpot's Identity team and a summer internship on iOS Games at the New York Times. In my free time I enjoy traveling and exploring new places, hiking, skiing, listening to music, drinking Dunkinâ€™ Donuts, and cheering on the Red Sox and Patriots.
