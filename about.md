I am a fourth-year computer science student at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. I grew up in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, about two hours outside Boston. I just finished up my second co-op at Apple working on the Siri team in Cupertino, California. In my free time I enjoy traveling and exploring new places, hiking, skiing, listening to music, drinking Dunkinâ€™ Donuts, and cheering on the Red Sox and Patriots.
