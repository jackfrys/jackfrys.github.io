I am a fifth-year computer science student at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. I grew up in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, about two hours outside the city. I completed my first and second co-ops at Apple working on the Siri team in Cupertino, California. Earlier this year, I split my third co-op term between a period on HubSpot's Identity team and a summer internship on iOS Games at the New York Times.

I graduate in a few weeks, and then I'm headed back to sunny California.

In my free time I enjoy battling crossword puzzles, listening to music and podcasts, drinking Dunkinâ€™ Donuts, traveling, skiing, and cheering on the Red Sox and Patriots. I'm hoping to take up scuba diving again in the short term and eventually learn to fly airplanes.

This is my best attempt to craft a personal website. Bear with me as I develop my tone and discover interesting things to write about.
